# Semigroup-to-Group Extension via Bochner's Theorem

States and (ultimately) proves the Bochner representation theorem for
positive-definite functions on the involutive semigroup `[0,∞) × ℝ^d`,
and derives the semigroup-to-group extension for positive-generator semigroups.

## Mathematical Background

In Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction, Euclidean time translations form a
contraction semigroup `e^{-tH}` (t ≥ 0), while Lorentzian time translations
form a unitary group `e^{itH}` (t ∈ ℝ). **Not every contraction semigroup
extends to a group** — the heat semigroup is a counterexample. The extension
requires a spectral positivity condition (H ≥ 0), guaranteed by OS reflection
positivity (E2).

The analytical bridge: the BCR Theorem 4.1.13 gives a Fourier-Laplace measure
representation for bounded continuous PD functions on `[0,∞) × ℝ^d`. The
measure μ is supported on `[0,∞) × ℝ^d`, and the Fourier integral
`G(t, a) = ∫ e^{itp} e^{i⟨a,q⟩} dμ(p,q)` extends the semigroup to all t ∈ ℝ.

/-! ## Group Extension from Bochner Representation

Given the measure `μ` from `semigroupGroupBochner` (supported on `[0,∞) × ℝ^d`),
the group extension uses the **Fourier** (not Laplace) kernel:

  `G(t, a) = ∫ e^{itp} e^{i⟨a, q⟩} dμ(p, q)`  for all `t ∈ ℝ`

This converges for all `t ∈ ℝ` because `|e^{itp}| = 1` and `μ` is finite.
For `t ≥ 0`, analytic continuation from `e^{-tp}` to `e^{itp}` relates
`G` to `F` via the substitution `t ↦ -it`. -/

/-- The Fourier group function from the Bochner measure.

Given the measure `μ` from `semigroupGroupBochner` (supported on `[0,∞) × ℝ^d`),
define `G(t, a) = ∫ e^{itp} e^{i⟨a,q⟩} dμ(p,q)` for ALL `t ∈ ℝ`.

**`G` is NOT a pointwise extension of `F`**. They use different kernels:
- `F(t, a) = ∫ e^{-tp} e^{i⟨a,q⟩} dμ` (Laplace, defined for `t ≥ 0`)
- `G(t, a) = ∫ e^{itp} e^{i⟨a,q⟩} dμ` (Fourier, defined for all `t ∈ ℝ`)

They are related by analytic continuation in the time parameter, not by
equality. The "semigroup-to-group" extension means: the PD condition on
`[0,∞)` (semigroup) yields a measure whose Fourier transform `G` is
automatically PD on all of `ℝ` (group). This is the group-level Bochner
theorem: continuous PD functions on the group `(ℝ, +)` are exactly the
Fourier transforms of finite positive measures.

Note: `G(s+t, a) ≠ G(s, a) · G(t, a)` in general (product of integrals
≠ integral of product). The "group" structure is encoded in the PD condition
`Σ c̄ᵢ cⱼ G(tⱼ - tᵢ, aⱼ - aᵢ) ≥ 0` holding for all `t ∈ ℝ`. -/

/-! ## Connection to QFT: Analytic Continuation to Unitary Group

The QFT application: given a contraction semigroup `S(t) = e^{-tH}` on a
**complex** Hilbert space with `H ≥ 0` (positive Hamiltonian), the spectral
theorem gives `S(t) = ∫ e^{-tλ} dE(λ)` where `E` is the spectral measure
supported on `[0, ∞)`. The **unitary** group is `U(t) = ∫ e^{itλ} dE(λ)`.

**Critical**: `S(t)` and `U(t)` are NOT the same operators. `S(t) = e^{-tH}`
is a contraction (dampens high frequencies), while `U(t) = e^{itH}` is unitary
(preserves norms). They are related by **analytic continuation** `t ↦ -it`,
NOT by equality. For unbounded `H` (any nontrivial QFT Hamiltonian), `S(t)`
is not invertible, so no bounded group `U` can satisfy `U(t) = S(t)` for
`t ≥ 0` with `U` also defined for `t < 0`.

The extension must happen on a **complex** Hilbert space, where the Wick
rotation `t ↦ -it` maps the real contraction semigroup to a unitary group.
This requires Stone's theorem (not yet in Mathlib) and the spectral theorem
for unbounded self-adjoint operators.

**Important**: The extension requires `H ≥ 0` (spectrum in `[0, ∞)`),
guaranteed by OS reflection positivity (E2). Without it, the heat semigroup
shows general contraction semigroups don't admit any such extension. -/

-- NOTE: The full complex-Hilbert-space version of this theorem requires:
-- 1. InnerProductSpace ℂ H (complex inner product)
-- 2. Unitary group U(t) : H →L[ℂ] H (complex-linear)
-- 3. Spectral theorem / Stone's theorem (not in Mathlib)
-- 4. The connection S(t) ↔ U(t) via analytic continuation, not pointwise equality
--
-- The contraction semigroup S(t) = e^{-tH} maps to the unitary group U(t) = e^{itH}
-- via the spectral measure: ⟨x, S(t)x⟩ = ∫ e^{-tλ} d⟨x, E(λ)x⟩ and
-- ⟨x, U(s)x⟩ = ∫ e^{isλ} d⟨x, E(λ)x⟩. These are NOT equal for real t = s;
-- they are related by analytic continuation t ↦ -it.
--
-- This is deferred until Stone's theorem and the spectral theorem for unbounded
-- self-adjoint operators are available in Mathlib.
